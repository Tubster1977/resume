      "Web development project built with React JS, with backend API database retrieval utilising Firebase. I explored routing, http-requests and application-wide state management together with hooks such as useRef and useHistory. The end-product was an ecological web-based application allowing volunteers for a local nature reserve to prioritise tasks and generate new ones. Scored 73% (distinction).
